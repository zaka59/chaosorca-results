This work is experimental in nature. I created these scripts and charts for use in my master's thesis. While they are not perfect and required some adjustments to certain timestamps, they can be further improved for better visualization of the actual experiments.
Despite these adjustments, I consider the results valid and suitable for use.


### Scripts

- `./organize_chaosorca_results.py` : creates csv files that can be used to generate charts.
- `./select_delay_1s.py` : delay injection on select().
- `./select_syscalls.py` : select() impact on other syscalls.
- `./errors_injection_latency.py` : charts with error injections on all syscalls.

### Data
- `./bookinfo.zip` : original experimental results on BookInfo provided by the author.
- `./tests` : reogranized csv files and charts.
